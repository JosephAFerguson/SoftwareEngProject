Docs are written using Typst (a programming language that compiles into PDFs). Feel free to write docs for
whatever you are working on in whatever way you want. 

If you want to write documentation in Typst or modify existing documentation written in Typst, source code
is in the Typst/ folder. If you choose to write your documentation a different way that isn't directly editable
(e.g. LaTeX), then please provide source code for that as well.
